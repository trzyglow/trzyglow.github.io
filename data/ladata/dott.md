## Prologue
When you get control of Bernard, move to the Rack for Fliers and pick up the Flier. Then go to the window next to the outside door and get the Help Wanted Sign. Lastly, go to the payphone and grab the Dime out of it. Head next to the Grandfather Clock and Open it to watch the cutscene.
After the cutscene, you don’t have to look far for the plans. Go to the right and look at the To Do bulletin board next to the Hamster Generator. The Patent Application is there so pick them up and you’ll learn how the Chron O' John sends objects to people in different times.

## Colonial Times
You can now control Hoagie so get the Patent Application. Head down and to the left past the carriage. Open the mailbox and get the Letter inside it. Open the door to the Inn and go inside. Open the door to the Main hall and enter and then head through the swinging door. Pick up the Oil and Spaghetti on the pantry and then head through the door to the right. Pick up the Bucket on the ground and then open the cabinet and get the Brush. Use the Bucket with the Water Pump to fill it with water.

Head back to the entrance and go up the stairs. Enter the room on the left and Use Washington’s bed and use the cord to get the Maid to appear.  Go outside the room and get the Soap on the cart. The next room has Betsy Ross, but there’s nothing to do there right now. The last room on the floor has a Wine Bottle in it so grab it.  Head past the horse upstairs and Pick up the Red Paint. Use Ned’s bed and it will squeak, then use the Squeaky Mattress with Jed’s Bed to switch them.  Now use Jed’s bed to make the cat move over and pick up the Squeaky Mouse Toy.

Return downstairs to the grandfather clock and open it to head downstairs to see Red Edison. Pick up the Left Handed Hammer, then give him the Patent Application and Red will tell you he needs Oil, Vinegar, and Gold for the Battery.  Give him the Oil and head outside. Go to the kumquat tree and use the Red Paint on it. Go meet Washington inside the Main Hall and talk to him about cherry trees and that he couldn’t chop one down to save his grandmother. The Tree gets chopped down and Laverne is now playable.

## Open the Safe
Before you start controlling Laverne, switch to Bernard and go into the Main Lobby. Go through the door into the convention room and Open the Grating. Go to the Chattering Teeth and follow them to trap it in the grating and then Pick them up. Go through the Swinging door into the Break area and pick up the Fork, Coffee, and Decaf. Head into the door to the right and get the Funnel from the Cabinet. 
Head back into the lobby and up the stairs. Open the first door where the fat guy is sleeping. Close the door and get the Keys from the lock and leave. Go past the second door and enter the Third door to see Green Tentacle. Push the Speaker down and then grab the Videotape and use the On/Off switch to see something fall off of the ceiling in the Main lobby. Go upstairs and to the right to see Edison’s son and Pick Up the Hamster. Go out and upstairs, into the next room and then outside. Get the Crank from the Crankbox and go down the chimney.

Pick up the Fake Barf on the ground in the lobby and go see Dr. Fred in his laboratory. He’ll talk about a contract he signed, so Use Decaf Coffee on his Coffee Mug to make him start sleep walking. Go upstairs into Edna’s surveillance room which is across from Weird Ed’s room. You can’t get rid of Edna now, so you’ll need to switch to Hoagie. Go to the room across from where the Horse is where Ned and Jed are sculpting. Switch the Right Handed Hammer with the Left Handed Hammer. The statue in the present is now altered so you can now push Edna out of the room.

Put the Videotape in the VCR and then Use the VCR. Press the Square button on the VCR to Record. Then it’ll show IRS agents come and take Fred away. Rewind the footage and switch the footage to EP on the far right. Play the footage and you’ll see the combination. Go down into Fred’s office in the lobby. Grab the Booboo-B-Gone from the desk drawer and the Swiss Bank Account from the Desk. Open the safe and grab the contract.

## Get Laverne a Disguise
Laverne is trapped in a kennel so talk to the guard and say you’re going to be sick. In the doctor’s office, pick up the Tentacle Chart and exit. Head outside to be sent back to the Kennel.  Tell the guard you need to go to the Bathroom and you’ll get to go outside so head to the Chron O John. Put the Tentacle Chart in there for Hoagie and give the Scalpel to Bernard.  Also have Hoagie give the Letter and Red Paint to Bernard.  Finally, give the Crank to Laverne. Head to Betsy Ross’s room and use the Tentacle chart on the Patterns to create a Tentacle flag in the future.  Go back to the kennel and tell the guard you don’t feel good.  Leave the vet and go through the big door behind you and up the Fireplace. Use the Crank with the Crankbox and then use the crank to lower the flag and pick it up. Select the Flag and Laverne will wear it from now on.

## Build the Battery
Switch to Hoagie and put the Wine Bottle in the Time Capsule next to Jefferson. After that, go outside and put the Can Opener in the Chron O' John for Laverne.

Laverne can now go anywhere so head outside and get the Can Opener. Once that's done, go outside and upstairs. Go into the first room and use the Can Opener on the Time Capsule to get the Vinegar. Head back outside and give it to Hoagie. 

The only thing left to get the battery is the Gold Plated Quill Pen used to write the Constitution. Switch to Bernard and head upstairs to where the guests stay. Enter the second room and talk to Dwayne who's suicidal. Use the Letter on him and he'll leave. Pick up the Disappearing Ink next to you and the Flag Gun on the ground. Head back into the convention area and use the Flag Gun on the Cigar Lighter to switch them. Talk to the novelty salesman about wanting another Cigar and both your head and the cigar will remain intact. Give the Cigar, Cigar Lighter, and Chattering Teeth to Hoagie.

Have Hoagie go to Washington and Use the Cigar on Washington and his teeth will blow out of his mouth. Give Washington the Chattering Teeth and Hancock will think he's cold which will light the fire. Grab the Blanket Hancock was using and then go upstairs and out the window to the chimney. Use the Blanket on the Chimney and the Founders will evacuate the room allowing you to obtain the Gold Plated Quill Pen. Give the Vinegar and the Gold Plated Quill Pen to Red Edison and you'll have the Battery built so grab it off of Red's shelf.

## Win the Human Contest
Have Laverne go to the Chron O' John and have Bernard give her the Fake Barf and the Fork. Also, have Hoagie give Laverne the Spaghetti which will become the Wet Soggy Noodles. Now have Laverne go into the big door and talk to the Blue Tentacle to get the Name Tags. Head upstairs to the second room with the Mummy. Get the Extension cord next to the Pink Flamingo. Get the Roller Skates on the table and then use them with the Mummy. The Mummy will be with the other contestants so put a Name Tag on him and he'll be your human for the contest. 

Go up to where the contestants are and use the Fake Barf on Harold to get him disqualified. Use the Wet Soggy Noodles on the Mummy. This won't be enough to have him win Best hair, so use the Fork on him to make his hair better. Go to the right and have the Judges do the Best Hair portion of the contest and you'll win. 

The next phase will be Best Smile. Have Bernard give Hoagie his Textbook. Then have Hoagie go upstairs to where the Horse is. Use the Textbook on the Horse to bore him to sleep and take his Dentures he left in the glass. Give the Dentures to Laverne and then have her put them on the Mummy. Ask the Judges to do the Best Smile contest and the Mummy will win. 

For the last contest, give Bernard the Scalpel. Go into the convention area and use the Scalpel on Oozo the Clown to pop him and take the Box 'o' Laughs. Give the Box 'o' Laughs to Laverne along with the Booboo-B-Gone and attach the Box 'o' Laughs to the Mummy. Ask the judges to do the Best Laugh portion and you'll have won the contest along with the Dinner Certificate.

Go down outside and use the Booboo-B-Gone on the Fence. Have Hoagie give the Squeaky Mouse Toy to Laverne and use it on the cat and take the cat with you. Give the Kennel Guard the Dinner Certificate and he'll leave. Use the switch to deactivate the forcefield and Use the Cat on the Edison's which they'll believe is a skunk and they'll run away, which will cause the Grandfather Clock guard to leave his post to run after them.

## Save Dr. Fred from the IRS
Switch back to Bernard and now it's time to save Fred from IRS agents. Fred is being held in the attic, but you can't go upstairs due to the IRS agents blocking the path to his room. Instead, go up the fireplace in the Convention area and then into the window. Pick up the rope Dr. Fred is tied up in and then go back outside. Use the Rope on the Pulley and then head down outside. Use the Dangling Rope on Dead Cousin Ted and then head back up to the pulley. Pull the Rope and Fred will be in Dr. Fred's room. If you haven't done so already, have Hoagie give the Red Paint to Bernard. Have Bernard go back up to where Dr. Fred is and use the Red Paint on Dead Cousin Ted. Then use Dead Cousin Ted with Dr. Fred and you'll fool the IRS agent. Use the Rope with Dr. Fred and then go outside and pull on the Rope. 

Dr. Fred is back in the lab, but he's unconscious. Use the Funnel on him and then use the Coffee on the Funnel to have him wake up. Use the Contract on Fred, but he won't sign it unless he's read it. Select the "Oh, Forget it" dialog option and then say that "you're starting a petition to ban all tentacles". Fred will then get tricked into signing the Contract.

## Charge the Battery
Have Bernard give Hoagie the Help Wanted Sign along with the Flier. Have Hoagie go over to the carriage and then combine the Soap with the Bucket Full of Water to make it Bucket Full of Soapy Water. Use the Brush with the Bucket Full of Soapy Water. Time will pass and a storm will be present and Ben Franklin will go inside. Go see Red Edison and give him the Help Wanted Sign and he'll allow you to have the Lab Coat. Head to Ben Franklin's room (right next to Betsy Ross) and give him the Lab Coat.

You'll be outside and Ben will ask you to throw the kite when he gives the signal. Before you let it go, attach the Battery to the Kite and then push it and the Lightning will charge the battery. Attach the Battery to the plug next to Hoagie's Chron-O-John and you're good to go.

## Charge Laverne's Chron-O-John
Go down the Grandfather clock to the basement. First off, you need a hamster to charge the generator, but you can't send it through the Chron-O-John. Have Bernard go upstairs to the Ice Machine and put the Hamster in there. Have Laverne go up to the Ice Machine, look at it, and pick up the Frozen Hamster. Go downstairs to the break room and put the Frozen Hamster in the Microwave to thaw him out, but he'll be soaking wet and won't run on the generator.

Switch to Bernard and go outside past the Mailbox. Talk to the guy breaking into the car and ask "What are you up to?" Then say "Here, Perhaps these are your keys" and then give him the Keys you got from the door in the sleeping fat guy's room and you'll get the Crowbar in exchange. Go inside and use the Crowbar on the Dime with Gum stuck to it on the ground to get the Dime. Head upstairs to where the man was sleeping. Use both Dimes on the Fickle Fingers coin slot and he'll fall off the bed so grab the sweater. Leave the room and use the Crowbar on the Candy Machine to get lots of quarters. Head downstairs to the laundry room (past the break room) and put the Sweater in the Dryer, close it, and use all the quarters on the Dryer Coin Slot.

Switch to Laverne and go down to the Laundry room. Get the Sweater which is now tiny and Use it on the Hamster. Go down the Grandfather Clock and put the Hamster on the Hamster Generator. A boxing glove will punch you and the Hamster will flee into the mouse hole.

To get the Hamster out of the hole, switch to Hoagie and have him put the Flier into the Suggestion box. A Vacuum will now be available to use in the future so use it on the mouse hole to get the Hamster. Open the Hatch to get the Hamster and then put him on the Generator. Plug the Extension Cord into the Outlet, and then use the Extension Cord on the Window to have it extend outside. Go outside and put the Extension Cord into the Plug to charge Laverne's Chron-O-John.

## Buy the Diamond
You need Dr. Fred's contract to get rich enough to buy the diamond, but you have to mail if first and you need a stamp as well. Go up to Weird Ed Edison's room and use the Disappearing Ink on his Stamp collection. He'll get mad and throw you out so pick up the Stamp and Stamp Album on the ground. Use the Stamp with the Contract to combine them. It's too late to mail the contract now, so send it to Hoagie and have him put it in the mailbox. Dr. Fred gets rich so go to the Suicidal Dwayne's room and use the TV to view a Diamond ad. Now use a phone (in either Suicidal Dwayne's room or Dr. Fred's office), while making sure you have the Swiss Bank Account. Use the phone and buy the diamond.

## Defeat Purple Tentacle
After the cutscene, you're now in the previous day and stuck as a 3 headed monster. Leave the room and Open the middle door (the R door) and Old Purple Tentacle will shrink you. Run inside the room and go into the Mouse Hole near the table. You'll be in Green Tentacle's room so get the Bowling Ball once you're back to normal height. Leave the room and Purple Tentacle is gone so head down to Dr. Fred's lab.

Use the Bowling Ball on the Tentacles to strike them out. Purple Tentacle will shrink you, but talk to him and choose the following dialogue options:

"Just what is it you have against Humans, anyway?"

"Sounds like that's all Dr. Fred's fault, really."

"You're pretty handy with that ray gun."

"Why don't you zap Dr. Fred if you hate him so much?"

This will backfire for Purple causing him to shrink and you'll win the game.
