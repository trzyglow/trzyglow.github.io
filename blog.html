		I wonder for how much longer the winamp repo will exist;<br>
		considering its continued violations against github TOS & basic EU laws, the copyright infringement and other licensing violations...<br>
		How did anyone at winamp think this was a good idea?<br>
		<br>
		"Oh yes, let's publicise our STOLEN code and disregard any valid legal issues."<br>
		And then they try to permanently delete some of the illegal parts... on git...<br>
		<br>
		At least now the real face of winamp was revealed.<br>
		<br>

		Got Doom95 running on Win11...<br>
		Weirdest "regular" Doom port I've ever played.<br>
		Not as bad as people say, definitely didn't age as well as BOOM.<br>
		<br>

		Thinking about making tracker music...<br>
		.<br>

		Things are slowly coming together...<br>

		Icon specifications are confusing, why can't everything just refer to a single svg file<br>
		(+ a legacy favicon.ico as a fallback)?<br>

		This new KEX-Engine port of Doom is amazing;<br>
		<br>
		a brand new expansion, no rest for the living<br>
		is finally available OOTB* for the first time<br>
		since Doom3 BFG, all of classic Doom (PC) in one<br>
		nicely presented package...<br>
		<br>
		And the complete Soundtrack by Andrew Hulshult...<br>
		<br><br>
		My only negative points so far are that the controls<br>
		feel spongy on mouse & keyboard, and the current GOG build seems a bit unstable...<br>
		<br><br>(* without requiring a bethesda account)
		<br><br><br>
		THIS IS NOT AN ADVERTISEMENT! I JUST LOVE DOOM.<br>
		<br>
		Addendum (09:44): The spongy controls were just a result of Windows 11 being weird.<br>

		Thinking about overhauling my monochrome<br>
		LUTs, some sort of seperate "Redux" version.<br>
		<br>
		Or a few more additions based on more<br>
		reference material...<br>

		Now, after re-watching them as an adult:<br>
		Holy shit, the Star Wars prequels are great...<br>
		(I still prefer the original trilogy)<br>

		So fucking tired of my feeds being flooded by<br>
		a neverending barrage of US-centric politics.<br>
		<br>
		Fling your political fecal matter elsewhere ffs...<br>

		WebP is a pretty neat format;<br>
		it's just hillariously unsupported...<br>

		Fell in love with monochrome amber colored<br>
		terminals...<br>
		<br>
		Oh, boy is it beautiful.<br>

		The political center is slowly dying,<br>
		and being replaced with indoctrinated nutjobs...<br>
		<br>
		Both right-wing and left-wing...<br>

		Been eating sunflower seeds so much recently,<br>
		it's now around 10% of my entire diet.<br>

		Time to delete all the "valuable" Instagram<br>
		content to prevent it being used for genAI...<br>
		<br>

		I wish Wine was a perfect compatibility layer...<br>
		Or companies porting their proprietary stuff<br>
		to Linux was the norm...<br>
		<br>
		Wouldn't be stuck having to use Windows<br>
		and could finally move my main system to Linux...<br>
		<br>
		The whole "Copilot+PC" and "Recall" stuff also<br>
		seems like pure dystopia to me.<br>
		<br>
		And there I was thinking Cortana was bad...<br>

		Have been getting back into FTP lately,<br>
		mostly because of classic DOOM.<br>
		<br>
		Still not fully used to it though...<br>

		I just created this blog-page to (one day)<br>
		actually start a public blog of some sort.<br>
		(Classic 90s/2000s internet style)<br>
		<br>
		Today is not really that day, but hey...<br>
		A start is a start...<br>
